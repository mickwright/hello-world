# hello-world
My introduction to GitHub

It's a pleasure to be here. I'm looking forward to learning from the GitHub community.

I'm a non-profit communications professional looking to advance my coding skills beyond simple HTML and CSS edits.

When I'm not working on digital projects, I enjoy reading, writing and running. 

Actually, I don't enjoy the running.

See you around.
